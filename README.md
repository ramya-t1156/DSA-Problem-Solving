# DSA-Problem-Solving
Documenting my journey in solving LeetCode problems and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. This repo will feature solutions to problems I solve daily, including explanations and code.

# LeetCode DSA Daily Streak

Welcome to my LeetCode DSA Daily Streak! This repository is where I track my journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode. As a beginner, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills, and this repository helps me stay consistent and motivated.

## Streak Goals

- **Solve one problem per day** to build consistency.
- **Master key DSA concepts**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Improve gradually**: Solutions may not always be optimal, but the focus is on learning and improving over time.

## Repository Structure

Each dayâ€™s solution is organized into its own folder, named by the date (e.g., `2024-11-05`). The folder contains:

- The **problem description** (as a markdown file).
- The **solution code** in the chosen programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- A brief **explanation** of my approach and thought process.


## Problem Categories

- **Array**
- **String**
- **Linked List**
- **Tree**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Graph**
